# PowerShellUiSampler Active Context

## Current Focus
The PowerShellUiSampler project is currently focused on demonstrating various ways to integrate PowerShell with .NET applications. The implementation provides both synchronous and asynchronous execution patterns with proper UI integration.

## Recent Implementations

### PowerShellWrapper
- Basic PowerShellWrapper implementation complete with:
  - Synchronous PowerShell execution
  - Asynchronous PowerShell execution with TPL
  - PowerShell script file execution
  - Support for loading PowerShell modules during initialization
  - Proper resource disposal with IDisposable

### TestApp
- WPF UI implementation complete with:
  - Tab-based interface for different execution scenarios
  - Progress bar for visual feedback
  - Color-coded output display for different PowerShell streams
  - Cancellation support for long-running operations
  - Pre-loaded PowerShell data on application startup

### Task Extensions
- Extension methods implemented for handling cancellation with PowerShell operations
- Integration between .NET's CancellationToken and PowerShell's Stop method

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Design Decisions
1. **Separate Library and UI**: Keeping the PowerShell wrapper code separate from the UI for better reusability
2. **Async/Await Pattern**: Using modern Task-based async patterns for better responsiveness
3. **Stream Handling**: Capturing and displaying all PowerShell output streams separately
4. **Cancellation Support**: Implementing proper cancellation for long-running operations

### Integration Points
- PowerShell module loading during initialization
- PowerShell script execution (both inline and from files)
- PowerShell output stream handling (error, warning, verbose, debug, progress)
- UI integration with PowerShell operations

## Next Steps

### Potential Improvements
1. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - More detailed error reporting
   - Better exception handling for PowerShell errors

2. **Additional Execution Patterns**:
   - Pipeline-based execution
   - Parameter binding examples
   - PowerShell remoting support

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - More detailed progress reporting
   - Save/load script functionality
   - Result filtering options

4. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for the PowerShellWrapper
   - Add integration tests for PowerShell execution

5. **Documentation**:
   - Add XML documentation to public methods
   - Create more comprehensive usage examples
