# PowerShellUiSampler Product Context

## Problem Statement
Integration between PowerShell and .NET applications has traditionally been challenging. Developers often struggle with:
- Managing PowerShell runspaces efficiently
- Handling PowerShell's various output streams (standard output, errors, warnings, etc.)
- Keeping the UI responsive when executing PowerShell commands
- Implementing proper cancellation for long-running operations
- Managing error handling across the PowerShell/.NET boundary

## Solution
This project provides a clean, reusable approach for invoking PowerShell commands from .NET applications with:
- A wrapper library that abstracts the complexity of PowerShell interaction
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous execution models
- Integration with the Task Parallel Library for multi-threading
- Proper cancellation support
- Complete error handling and stream redirection

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Make PowerShell integration straightforward for .NET developers
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the UI remains responsive during PowerShell execution
- **Visibility**: Show all PowerShell output streams clearly in the UI
- **Control**: Allow users to cancel long-running operations
- **Extensibility**: Provide a pattern that can be extended for specific use cases

## Use Cases
1. **Simple Script Execution**: Run PowerShell commands and display results
2. **Script File Execution**: Load and run PowerShell script files
3. **Multi-threaded Operations**: Run commands that don't block the UI thread
4. **Stream Handling**: Process and display various PowerShell output streams
5. **Cancellation**: Cancel long-running PowerShell operations
6. **Pre-initialization**: Load PowerShell modules and pre-initialize state before execution

## Value Proposition
This sample implementation demonstrates best practices for PowerShell/.NET integration, allowing developers to:
- Leverage PowerShell's automation capabilities within .NET applications
- Build responsive UIs that don't freeze during PowerShell operations
- Handle PowerShell output streams in a user-friendly manner
- Implement robust cancellation and error handling
