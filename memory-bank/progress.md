# PowerShellUiSampler Progress

## Current Status
The PowerShellUiSampler project is currently in a working state with core functionality implemented. It serves as a demonstration of how to integrate PowerShell with .NET applications using both synchronous and asynchronous approaches.

## What Works

### PowerShellWrapper Library
✅ Basic runspace creation and management  
✅ Synchronous PowerShell execution (`InvokeSynchronous`)  
✅ Asynchronous PowerShell execution with TPL (`Invoke`)  
✅ PowerShell script file execution (`InvokeScriptFileSynchronous`)  
✅ PowerShell module loading during initialization  
✅ Proper resource disposal via IDisposable implementation  
✅ Extension methods for Task cancellation handling  

### TestApp UI
✅ Tab-based interface with different execution scenarios  
✅ Execution of PowerShell scripts with output display  
✅ Loading and running PowerShell script files  
✅ Display of different PowerShell output streams (error, warning, verbose, debug)  
✅ Progress bar updates during execution  
✅ Cancellation of long-running operations  
✅ Pre-initialized PowerShell data on application load  
✅ Color-coded output display based on stream type  

## What's Left to Build

### PowerShellWrapper Enhancements
- [ ] Support for PowerShell parameter binding
- [ ] Pipeline-based execution patterns
- [ ] PowerShell remoting capabilities
- [ ] Credential management for secure operations
- [ ] Better error reporting and handling
- [ ] Support for PowerShell Core (cross-platform)

### UI Improvements
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for PowerShell scripts
- [ ] Save/load functionality for scripts
- [ ] More detailed progress reporting
- [ ] Result filtering and searching
- [ ] Settings persistence
- [ ] Additional examples of PowerShell integration
- [ ] Script execution history

### Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Unit tests for PowerShellWrapper
- [ ] Integration tests for PowerShell execution
- [ ] XML documentation for public APIs
- [ ] More comprehensive usage examples
- [ ] Wiki or documentation pages

## Known Issues

1. **Hard-coded Module Path**:
   - The sample code in MainWindow.xaml.cs uses a hard-coded path (`D:\TestModule.psm1`) for loading modules
   - This should be made configurable or use a relative path for better portability

2. **Limited Error Handling**:
   - Basic error handling is implemented, but more robust error reporting would be beneficial
   - PowerShell exceptions could be parsed and displayed more effectively

3. **No Script Validation**:
   - Currently, there's no validation or syntax checking before executing scripts
   - Could lead to unexpected errors during execution

4. **UI Threading Issues**:
   - While the code uses Dispatcher.Invoke for UI updates, there may be edge cases where threading issues could occur
   - More comprehensive thread safety measures may be needed

## Next Actions

1. Address the hard-coded module path issue
2. Enhance error handling with more detailed error reporting
3. Add script validation before execution
4. Implement XML documentation for public APIs
5. Develop unit tests for the PowerShellWrapper class
